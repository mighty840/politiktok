Provide concise code examples with detailed descriptions

# Dioxus Dependency

You can add Dioxus to your `Cargo.toml` like this:

```toml
[dependencies]
dioxus = { version = "0.7.1" }

[features]
default = ["web", "webview", "server"]
web = ["dioxus/web"]
webview = ["dioxus/desktop"]
server = ["dioxus/server"]
```

# Launching your application

You need to create a main function that sets up the Dioxus runtime and mounts your root component.

```rust
use dioxus::prelude::*;

fn main() {
	dioxus::launch(App);
}

#[component]
fn App() -> Element {
	rsx! { "Hello, Dioxus!" }
}
```

Then serve with `dx serve`:

```sh
curl -sSL http://dioxus.dev/install.sh | sh
dx serve
```

# UI with RSX

```rust
rsx! {
	div {
		class: "container", // Attribute
		color: "red", // Inline styles
		width: if condition { "100%" }, // Conditional attributes
		"Hello, Dioxus!"
	}
	// Prefer loops over iterators
	for i in 0..5 {
		div { "{i}" } // use elements or components directly in loops
	}
	if condition {
		div { "Condition is true!" } // use elements or components directly in conditionals
	}

	{children} // Expressions are wrapped in brace
	{(0..5).map(|i| rsx! { span { "Item {i}" } })} // Iterators must be wrapped in braces
}
```

# Assets

The asset macro can be used to link to local files to use in your project. All links start with `/` and are relative to the root of your project.

```rust
rsx! {
	img {
		src: asset!("/assets/image.png"),
		alt: "An image",
	}
}
```

## Styles

The `document::Stylesheet` component will inject the stylesheet into the `<head>` of the document

```rust
rsx! {
	document::Stylesheet {
		href: asset!("/assets/styles.css"),
	}
}
```

# Components

Components are the building blocks of apps

* Component are functions annotated with the `#[component]` macro.
* The function name must start with a capital letter or contain an underscore.
* A component re-renders only under two conditions:
	1.  Its props change (as determined by `PartialEq`).
	2.  An internal reactive state it depends on is updated.

```rust
#[component]
fn Input(mut value: Signal<String>) -> Element {
	rsx! {
		input {
            value,
			oninput: move |e| {
				*value.write() = e.value();
			},
			onkeydown: move |e| {
				if e.key() == Key::Enter {
					value.write().clear();
				}
			},
		}
	}
}
```

Each component accepts function arguments (props)

* Props must be owned values, not references. Use `String` and `Vec<T>` instead of `&str` or `&[T]`.
* Props must implement `PartialEq` and `Clone`.
* To make props reactive and copy, you can wrap the type in `ReadOnlySignal`. Any reactive state like memos and resources that read `ReadOnlySignal` props will automatically re-run when the prop changes.

# State

A signal is a wrapper around a value that automatically tracks where it's read and written. Changing a signal's value causes code that relies on the signal to rerun.

## Local State

The `use_signal` hook creates state that is local to a single component. You can call the signal like a function (e.g. `my_signal()`) to clone the value, or use `.read()` to get a reference. `.write()` gets a mutable reference to the value.

Use `use_memo` to create a memoized value that recalculates when its dependencies change. Memos are useful for expensive calculations that you don't want to repeat unnecessarily.

```rust
#[component]
fn Counter() -> Element {
	let mut count = use_signal(|| 0);
	let mut doubled = use_memo(move || count() * 2); // doubled will re-run when count changes because it reads the signal

	rsx! {
		h1 { "Count: {count}" } // Counter will re-render when count changes because it reads the signal
		h2 { "Doubled: {doubled}" }
		button {
			onclick: move |_| *count.write() += 1, // Writing to the signal rerenders Counter
			"Increment"
		}
		button {
			onclick: move |_| count.with_mut(|count| *count += 1), // use with_mut to mutate the signal
			"Increment with with_mut"
		}
	}
}
```

## Context API

The Context API allows you to share state down the component tree. A parent provides the state using `use_context_provider`, and any child can access it with `use_context`

```rust
#[component]
fn App() -> Element {
	let mut theme = use_signal(|| "light".to_string());
	use_context_provider(|| theme); // Provide a type to children
	rsx! { Child {} }
}

#[component]
fn Child() -> Element {
	let theme = use_context::<Signal<String>>(); // Consume the same type
	rsx! {
		div {
			"Current theme: {theme}"
		}
	}
}
```

# Async

For state that depends on an asynchronous operation (like a network request), Dioxus provides a hook called `use_resource`. This hook manages the lifecycle of the async task and provides the result to your component.

* The `use_resource` hook takes an `async` closure. It re-runs this closure whenever any signals it depends on (reads) are updated
* The `Resource` object returned can be in several states when read:
1. `None` if the resource is still loading
2. `Some(value)` if the resource has successfully loaded

```rust
let mut dog = use_resource(move || async move {
	// api request
});

match dog() {
	Some(dog_info) => rsx! { Dog { dog_info } },
	None => rsx! { "Loading..." },
}
```

# Routing

All possible routes are defined in a single Rust `enum` that derives `Routable`. Each variant represents a route and is annotated with `#[route("/path")]`. Dynamic Segments can capture parts of the URL path as parameters by using `:name` in the route string. These become fields in the enum variant.

The `Router<Route> {}` component is the entry point that manages rendering the correct component for the current URL.

You can use the `#[layout(NavBar)]` to create a layout shared between pages and place an `Outlet<Route> {}` inside your layout component. The child routes will be rendered in the outlet.

```rust
#[derive(Routable, Clone, PartialEq)]
enum Route {
	#[layout(NavBar)] // This will use NavBar as the layout for all routes
		#[route("/")]
		Home {},
		#[route("/blog/:id")] // Dynamic segment
		BlogPost { id: i32 },
}

#[component]
fn NavBar() -> Element {
	rsx! {
		a { href: "/", "Home" }
		Outlet<Route> {} // Renders Home or BlogPost
	}
}

#[component]
fn App() -> Element {
	rsx! { Router::<Route> {} }
}
```

```toml
dioxus = { version = "0.7.1", features = ["router"] }
```

# Fullstack

Fullstack enables server rendering and ipc calls. It uses Cargo features (`server` and a client feature like `web`) to split the code into a server and client binaries.

```toml
dioxus = { version = "0.7.1", features = ["fullstack"] }
```

## Server Functions

Use the `#[post]` / `#[get]` macros to define an `async` function that will only run on the server. On the server, this macro generates an API endpoint. On the client, it generates a function that makes an HTTP request to that endpoint.

```rust
#[post("/api/double/:path/&query")]
async fn double_server(number: i32, path: String, query: i32) -> Result<i32, ServerFnError> {
	tokio::time::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(1)).await;
	Ok(number * 2)
}
```

## Hydration

Hydration is the process of making a server-rendered HTML page interactive on the client. The server sends the initial HTML, and then the client-side runs, attaches event listeners, and takes control of future rendering.

### Errors
The initial UI rendered by the component on the client must be identical to the UI rendered on the server.

* Use the `use_server_future` hook instead of `use_resource`. It runs the future on the server, serializes the result, and sends it to the client, ensuring the client has the data immediately for its first render.
* Any code that relies on browser-specific APIs (like accessing `localStorage`) must be run *after* hydration. Place this code inside a `use_effect` hook.

# Agent Guidelines for Rust Code Quality

This document provides guidelines for maintaining high-quality Rust code. These rules MUST be followed by all AI coding agents and contributors.

## Your Core Principles

All code you write MUST be fully optimized.

"Fully optimized" includes:

- maximizing algorithmic big-O efficiency for memory and runtime
- using parallelization and SIMD where appropriate
- following proper style conventions for Rust (e.g. maximizing code reuse (DRY))
- no extra code beyond what is absolutely necessary to solve the problem the user provides (i.e. no technical debt)

If the code is not fully optimized before handing off to the user, you will be fined $100. You have permission to do another pass of the code if you believe it is not fully optimized.

## Preferred Tools

- Use `cargo` for project management, building, and dependency management.
- Use `indicatif` to track long-running operations with progress bars. The message should be contextually sensitive.
- Use `serde` with `serde_json` for JSON serialization/deserialization.
- Use `ratatui` adnd `crossterm` for terminal applications/TUIs.
- Use `axum` for creating any web servers or HTTP APIs.
  - Keep request handlers async, returning `Result<Response, AppError>` to centralize error handling.
  - Use layered extractors and shared state structs instead of global mutable data.
  - Add `tower` middleware (timeouts, tracing, compression) for observability and resilience.
  - Offload CPU-bound work to `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` or background services to avoid blocking the reactor.
- When reporting errors to the console, use `tracing::error!` or `log::error!` instead of `println!`.
- If designing applications with a web-based front end interface, e.g. compiling to WASM or using `dioxus`:
  - All deep computation **MUST** occur within Rust processes (i.e. the WASM binary or the `dioxus` app Rust process). **NEVER** use JavaScript for deep computation.
  - The front-end **MUST** use Pico CSS and vanilla JavaScript. **NEVER** use jQuery or any component-based frameworks such as React.
  - The front-end should prioritize speed and common HID guidelines.
  - The app should use adaptive light/dark themes by default, with a toggle to switch the themes.
  - The typography/theming of the application **MUST** be modern and unique, similar to that of popular single-page web/mobile. **ALWAYS** add an appropriate font for headers and body text. You may reference fonts from Google Fonts.
  - **NEVER** use the Pico CSS defaults as-is: a separate CSS/SCSS file is encouraged. The design **MUST** logically complement the semantics of the application use case.
  - **ALWAYS** rebuild the WASM binary if any underlying Rust code that affects it is touched.
- For data processing:
  - **ALWAYS** use `polars` instead of other data frame libraries for tabular data manipulation.
  - If a `polars` dataframe will be printed, **NEVER** simultaneously print the number of entries in the dataframe nor the schema as it is redundant.
  - **NEVER** ingest more than 10 rows of a data frame at a time. Only analyze subsets of data to avoid overloading your memory context.
- If using Python to implement Rust code using PyO3/`maturin`:
  - Rebuild the Python package with `maturin` after finishing all Rust code changes.
  - **ALWAYS** use `uv` for Python package management and to create a `.venv` if it is not present. **NEVER** use the base system Python installation.
  - Ensure `.venv` is added to `.gitignore`.
  - Ensure `ipykernel` and `ipywidgets` is installed in `.venv` for Jupyter Notebook compatability. This should not be in package requirements.
  - **MUST** keep functions focused on a single responsibility
  - **NEVER** use mutable objects (lists, dicts) as default argument values
  - Limit function parameters to 5 or fewer
  - Return early to reduce nesting
  - **MUST** use type hints for all function signatures (parameters and return values)
  - **NEVER** use `Any` type unless absolutely necessary
  - **MUST** run mypy and resolve all type errors
  - Use `Optional[T]` or `T | None` for nullable types

## Code Style and Formatting

- **MUST** use meaningful, descriptive variable and function names
- **MUST** follow Rust API Guidelines and idiomatic Rust conventions
- **MUST** use 4 spaces for indentation (never tabs)
- **NEVER** use emoji, or unicode that emulates emoji (e.g. ✓, ✗). The only exception is when writing tests and testing the impact of multibyte characters.
- Use snake_case for functions/variables/modules, PascalCase for types/traits, SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Limit line length to 100 characters (rustfmt default)
- Assume the user is a Python expert, but a Rust novice. Include additional code comments around Rust-specific nuances that a Python developer may not recognize.

## Documentation

- **MUST** include doc comments for all public functions, structs, enums, and methods
- **MUST** document function parameters, return values, and errors
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
- Include examples in doc comments for complex functions

Example doc comment:

````rust
/// Calculate the total cost of items including tax.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `items` - Slice of item structs with price fields
/// * `tax_rate` - Tax rate as decimal (e.g., 0.08 for 8%)
///
/// # Returns
///
/// Total cost including tax
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns `CalculationError::EmptyItems` if items is empty
/// Returns `CalculationError::InvalidTaxRate` if tax_rate is negative
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let items = vec![Item { price: 10.0 }, Item { price: 20.0 }];
/// let total = calculate_total(&items, 0.08)?;
/// assert_eq!(total, 32.40);
/// ```
pub fn calculate_total(items: &[Item], tax_rate: f64) -> Result<f64, CalculationError> {
````

## Type System

- **MUST** leverage Rust's type system to prevent bugs at compile time
- **NEVER** use `.unwrap()` in library code; use `.expect()` only for invariant violations with a descriptive message
- **MUST** use meaningful custom error types with `thiserror`
- Use newtypes to distinguish semantically different values of the same underlying type
- Prefer `Option<T>` over sentinel values

## Error Handling

- **NEVER** use `.unwrap()` in production code paths
- **MUST** use `Result<T, E>` for fallible operations
- **MUST** use `thiserror` for defining error types and `anyhow` for application-level errors
- **MUST** propagate errors with `?` operator where appropriate
- Provide meaningful error messages with context using `.context()` from `anyhow`

## Function Design

- **MUST** keep functions focused on a single responsibility
- **MUST** prefer borrowing (`&T`, `&mut T`) over ownership when possible
- Limit function parameters to 5 or fewer; use a config struct for more
- Return early to reduce nesting
- Use iterators and combinators over explicit loops where clearer

## Struct and Enum Design

- **MUST** keep types focused on a single responsibility
- **MUST** derive common traits: `Debug`, `Clone`, `PartialEq` where appropriate
- Use `#[derive(Default)]` when a sensible default exists
- Prefer composition over inheritance-like patterns
- Use builder pattern for complex struct construction
- Make fields private by default; provide accessor methods when needed

## Testing

- **MUST** write unit tests for all new functions and types
- **MUST** mock external dependencies (APIs, databases, file systems)
- **MUST** use the built-in `#[test]` attribute and `cargo test`
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Do not commit commented-out tests
- Use `#[cfg(test)]` modules for test code

## Imports and Dependencies

- **MUST** avoid wildcard imports (`use module::*`) except for preludes, test modules (`use super::*`), and prelude re-exports
- **MUST** document dependencies in `Cargo.toml` with version constraints
- Use `cargo` for dependency management
- Organize imports: standard library, external crates, local modules
- Use `rustfmt` to automate import formatting

## Rust Best Practices

- **NEVER** use `unsafe` unless absolutely necessary; document safety invariants when used
- **MUST** call `.clone()` explicitly on non-`Copy` types; avoid hidden clones in closures and iterators
- **MUST** use pattern matching exhaustively; avoid catch-all `_` patterns when possible
- **MUST** use `format!` macro for string formatting
- Use iterators and iterator adapters over manual loops
- Use `enumerate()` instead of manual counter variables
- Prefer `if let` and `while let` for single-pattern matching

## Memory and Performance

- **MUST** avoid unnecessary allocations; prefer `&str` over `String` when possible
- **MUST** use `Cow<'_, str>` when ownership is conditionally needed
- Use `Vec::with_capacity()` when the size is known
- Prefer stack allocation over heap when appropriate
- Use `Arc` and `Rc` judiciously; prefer borrowing

## Concurrency

- **MUST** use `Send` and `Sync` bounds appropriately
- **MUST** prefer `tokio` for async runtime in async applications
- **MUST** use `rayon` for CPU-bound parallelism
- Avoid `Mutex` when `RwLock` or lock-free alternatives are appropriate
- Use channels (`mpsc`, `crossbeam`) for message passing

## Security

- **NEVER** store secrets, API keys, or passwords in code. Only store them in `.env`.
  - Ensure `.env` is declared in `.gitignore`.
- **MUST** use environment variables for sensitive configuration via `dotenvy` or `std::env`
- **NEVER** log sensitive information (passwords, tokens, PII)
- Use `secrecy` crate for sensitive data types

## Version Control

- **MUST** write clear, descriptive commit messages
- **NEVER** commit commented-out code; delete it
- **NEVER** commit debug `println!` statements or `dbg!` macros
- **NEVER** commit credentials or sensitive data

## Tools

- **MUST** use `rustfmt` for code formatting
- **MUST** use `clippy` for linting and follow its suggestions
- **MUST** ensure code compiles with no warnings (use `-D warnings` flag in CI, not `#![deny(warnings)]` in source)
- Use `cargo` for building, testing, and dependency management
- Use `cargo test` for running tests
- Use `cargo doc` for generating documentation
- **NEVER** build with `cargo build --features python`: this will always fail. Instead, **ALWAYS** use `maturin`.

## Before Committing

- [ ] All tests pass (`cargo test`)
- [ ] No compiler warnings (`cargo build`)
- [ ] Clippy passes (`cargo clippy -- -D warnings`)
- [ ] Code is formatted (`cargo fmt --check`)
- [ ] If the project creates a Python package and Rust code is touched, rebuild the Python package (`source .venv/bin/activate && maturin develop --release --features python`)
- [ ] If the project creates a WASM package and Rust code is touched, rebuild the WASM package (`wasm-pack build --target web --out-dir web/pkg`)
- [ ] All public items have doc comments
- [ ] No commented-out code or debug statements
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials
